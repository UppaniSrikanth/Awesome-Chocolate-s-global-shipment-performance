🧭 Project Workflow Summary

Here’s a snapshot of the end-to-end process followed for this project:

Data Extraction (SQL):

Collected sales and shipment data from multiple relational tables.

Used JOIN, GROUP BY, and WHERE clauses to merge and refine datasets.

Exported the cleaned dataset into CSV format for Power BI integration.

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query):

Removed duplicates, handled null values, and corrected column data types.

Created custom calculated columns such as Profit per Product and Delivery Delay Days.

Renamed columns for clarity and applied proper formatting standards.

Data Modeling (Power BI):

Established one-to-many relationships between key tables.

Built calculated measures with DAX to compute KPIs dynamically.

Verified model integrity using relationship view.

Dashboard Creation & Design:

Applied consistent color palette (professional blue and white theme).

Added clear titles and aligned visuals for readability.

Designed a balanced layout with KPIs on top, trend charts in the center, and category visuals below.

Storytelling & Insights Presentation:

Connected the visuals logically to narrate a business story from data.

Added slicers and filters for interactivity — enabling users to drill down region or product-wise.

Highlighted actionable insights for business improvement.

🎯 Future Improvements

If extended, this project could include:

Integration with Power BI Service for live dashboards and automatic refresh.

Advanced DAX measures for forecasting sales trends.

Python or R integration for predictive analytics (e.g., predicting future sales or shipment delays).

Dynamic tooltips and bookmarks for enhanced storytelling and user experience.

💬 Reflections

Working on this project has been an incredible experience that strengthened my end-to-end analytical thinking.
I realized that true data storytelling doesn’t just come from charts — it comes from understanding the why behind every number.

Through this project, I practiced how a Power BI Developer or Data Analyst transforms a basic dataset into a visually rich, insight-driven dashboard that supports real business decisions.

🌟 Final Thoughts

This Power BI report stands as a strong demonstration of my ability to:

Work through the complete data lifecycle (SQL → Cleaning → Modeling → Visualization).

Use DAX measures to create dynamic and interactive reports.

Apply data storytelling techniques to communicate insights clearly.
